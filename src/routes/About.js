          <p>
            Milford Cinema was opened in Northshore City in 1984, 
            and has since been one of the largest cinemas in the Auckland Region. 
            After a major renovation in 2016, it now has six viewing rooms, 
            which can accommodate up to 600 people in total 
            and two of which are equipped with IMAX systems. Besides acoustically optimized room layout 
            and ergonomically designed chairs to maximize the joy of movie-watching, 
            we have also made every effort to make every detail perfect. 
            Each viewing room is built with its own restroom, 
            which is equipped with monitors showing the same movie synchronously 
            to make sure you miss as little plot as possible. 
            Along with the renovation, our website was redesigned as well to give you a smoother process of booking tickets online. 
            With your everlasting support, we are commited to bringing you the best watching experience.
